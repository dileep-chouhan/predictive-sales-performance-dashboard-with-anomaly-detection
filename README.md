# Predictive Sales Performance Dashboard with Anomaly Detection

**Overview:**

This project develops a sales performance dashboard that goes beyond simple visualization.  It leverages data analysis techniques to proactively identify anomalies in sales patterns.  By detecting unusual sales fluctuations, the dashboard enables businesses to intervene quickly, improve forecasting accuracy, and ultimately optimize sales strategies. The analysis incorporates data cleaning, trend analysis, anomaly detection, and data visualization to provide a comprehensive view of sales performance and potential risks or opportunities.


**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (for anomaly detection - optional, specify if used)


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required Python libraries listed above using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   *(Note:  Make sure your data file is in the correct location as specified within the script.)*


**Example Output:**

The script will produce the following outputs:

* **Console Output:**  Printed summary statistics, including key performance indicators (KPIs) and a summary of detected anomalies.
* **Plot Files:**  Several visualizations will be generated as image files (e.g., `sales_trend.png`, `anomaly_detection.png`), illustrating sales trends, seasonality, and detected anomalies.  These files will be saved in the project's directory.
